# Simple Neural Network from Scratch

To install project dependencies, please create a **python3** virtual environment by
excecuting `python3 -m venv env`. Install dependencies using `pip install requirements.txt`
and activate the virtual environment: `. path/to/env/bin/activate`.

The module **stradimod** contains the source code. In the root directory you will find
`test_case.py`, which contains an example of how to use the Network.
